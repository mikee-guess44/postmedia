This App allows users to store files in the Arweave block chain, in an easy and fast way.
It consists of two modules, the Uploader and the Scanner

Uploader accepts any type of image, audio and video. It also allows multiple file uploads.
For example, if you have 1000 images to upload, you can upload them all at once.

Another available function is to download the data from the stored files, structured in a Json file, with the Export Json File button
If you have 1000 files, this file will provide you with a clean data structure including link, id, name, size, and type.

The scanner classifies the files by image, audio and video, represents them separately.
Clicking on a file will open the Arweave link, you can also play the videos and audios in this same application.

The design of the app allows you to activate and deactivate each module and change its position to your liking.

The avatar that appears next to your address, changes when you click it, select the one that most identified with you!
